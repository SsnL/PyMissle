This game is written on Mac with Pygame 1.9.2.
It turns out that it works on Windows with Pygame 1.9.1.
Although the graphics look a little different.
If you open it with idle and then run it, the exit function might not work, and there would be a error.
But the exit function is fine with Eclipse, Terminal(mac) and CMD(PC).
But if you just run it with python interpreter, it works. 
Windows version installer of Pygame 1.9.1 is in /Pygame folder.
